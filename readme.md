# Noon Token Sale Community Audit

## Introduction
Our team is working as the technical partner of [Noon Capital](http://noon.sg)  and [Mithqal](http://mithqal.io)  on a new smart contract, backed by a real estate portfolio in Thailand, Phuket.

Before we launch it, I would like to publish the contracts and ask the community to review it. You can find the requirements in the doc folder.

## Contact Us
You can report bugs by starting a new issue here on GitHub, or fork this repository and create a pull request.
 
## The reward
If you find security leaks, bugs, or recommend meaningful improvements you will take place in a raffle draw and if you win, you can have a one-week holiday in one of the [apartments](https://via.eviivo.com/TowerCondominium83130) for free. The offer is valid for both review rounds (see below). We will draw 4 one week slots.
 
## Timing
The launch date of the ICO is yet to be determined. 
Until then we accept bug reports.

 ## Testing
 The address of the tokens sale contract on Rinkeby is [`0x6f8bbbb1aff05419edf07484c0b12740ab586a2f`](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6f8bbbb1aff05419edf07484c0b12740ab586a2f) and the Token is [`0xa6450dce496281eab766907829268e42a22a6dd6`](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/token/0xa6450dce496281eab766907829268e42a22a6dd6)
