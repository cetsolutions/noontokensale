# Noon Token Sale Community Audit

## Introduction
Our team is working as the technical partner of [Noon Capital](http://noon.sg)  and [Mithqal](http://mithqal.io)  on a new smart contract, backed by a real estate portfolio in Thailand, Phuket.

Before we launch it, I would like to publish the contracts and ask the community to review it. You can find the requirements in the doc folder.

## Contact Us
You can report bugs by starting a new issue here on GitHub, or fork this repository and create a pull request.
 
## The reward
If you find security leaks, bugs, or recommend meaningful improvements you will take place in a raffle draw and if you win, you can have a one-week holiday in one of the [apartments](https://via.eviivo.com/TowerCondominium83130) for free. The offer is valid for both review rounds (see below). We will draw 4 one week slots.
 
## Timing
The schedule of the reviews is the following:
 1. **First round** community review from **March 5 to March 11**: We publish the code and the requirements.
 2. **Second round** community review from **March 14 to March 22**: The improved code will be published on GitHub and one of the test network.
